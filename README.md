# Hi guys! ðŸ‘‹

I`m a motivated Frontend developer, with an extensive UI & UX background and Web Accessibility commitment.

Combining these worlds inspires me to develop new projects focused on the user experience.

I am here to use my skills, give my knowledge and share my passions in order to participate in challenges that lead all of us to a better way.
